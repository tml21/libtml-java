# LibTML for Java #

**TML Messaging Suite** is a network messaging library for rapid development of extensible and scalable interfaces. Based on the peer to peer standard protocol [BEEP](http://www.beepcore.org) (Blocks Extensible Exchange Protocol), defined in [RFC3080](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3080) and [RFC3081](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3081) libTML is suitable for many use cases and communication patterns. Equipped with a type safe data API, TML can transport hierarchical data structures fast and reliable. [**read more ...**][1]

**libTML for Java** is not only a JNI binding to the core library but a complete set of classes to simplify the usage of libTML in Java applications and apps. Multiple platforms are supported.

- Android

- Windows

The TML Messaging Suite is licensed under [LGPL 2.1][9] and can be used for open source and commercial projects according to the [license terms][10].
